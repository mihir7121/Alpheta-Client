Strength, spirit, and style are what youâ€™ll need to survive in The Ethereal Enclave. \n\nIn addition to the high-resolution artwork, each 0N1 NFT grants access to benefits found on the 0N1force website and Discord--the first of which is participation in a collaborative RPG that takes players into the 0N1verse. \n\nON1 FORCE may now claim their FRAMES! \n\nCLAIM: [NANOHUB](https://nanohub.0n1force.com)  \nCOLLECTION: [0N1 FRAMES](https://opensea.io/collection/0n1-frame)  \nWEBSITE: [0N1 FORCE](https://0N1Force.com)  \n\n**IMPORTANT:** 0N1 FRAMES are owned by their 0N1 FORCE NFTs. By transfer or selling your original 0N1 Force NFT you also give ownership of the 0N1 FRAMES to the wallet owner.",
