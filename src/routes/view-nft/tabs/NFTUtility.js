            <h1>The Bathroom</h1>
            <p>The bathroom is a digital representation of a private physical space to write whatever comes to you on the walls freely. Further, encouraging some “creative” fun, the BAYC website states the bathroom “is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives”.
                The canvas space allows each ape holder access to the bathroom every 15 minutes to paint a pixel on the wall of their choice. The exclusivity, option of anonymity, and the freedom to be creative are a few ways BAYC is growing its momentum of membership engagement.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Members have the commercial usage rights to their apes. Meaning they can make and sell prints, T-shirts, coffee mugs, etc.</li>
                <li>BAYC also released their own merch, which was exclusive to Bored Ape NFT owners. This required members to sign in using their ETH wallet to verify ownership prior to purchase.</li>
                <li>BAYC members have a say in where the project’s funds go. As a bonus, these community initiatives have donated millions to various charities.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Bored Ape Kennel Club</h1>
            <p>Fearing the apes may get lonely in the swamp, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) set up Bored Ape Kennel Club. As such, Bored Ape Kennel Club allows every ape to adopt its own four-legged friend! What’s more, apes could adopt a Club Dog NFT for free (gas fees not included). Available during one week of June 2021, members could sign up to adopt with a surprise reveal of the dogs at the end of the adoption period. The Bored Ape NFTs served as an adoption entry ticket, with a maximum of one Club Dog NFT per ape. 96% of Bored Ape members adopted a canine friend. The remaining 400 dogs were released into the swamp, never to be seen again.</p>
            <h1>Mutant Ape Yacht Club</h1>
            <p>Another example of how Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) engages its members is the distribution of mutant serum vials. An airdrop was given to members following a snapshot of Bored Ape holders on August 8th, 2021. Also, the minting opportunities of 10,000 Mutant Apes became available in a public Dutch auction. Accordingly, the cost to mint a Mutant Ape was reduced from three ETH to .01 ETH over nine hours. At the end of the auction, Mutant Apes were unveiled, and BAYC members were able to begin mutating their apes with serums. Recent roadmap updates have announced even more members-only utility, including a scavenger hunt, BAYC project narrative updates, games, and more on the horizon.</p>
            <h1>The $Ape Token</h1>
            <p>March 2022 was a big month for Yuga Labs. Just days after the announcement that they’d acquired CryptoPunks and Meebits, they announced the launch of a new token, ApeCoin ($APE). ApeCoin is billed as a “token for culture, gaming, and commerce used to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.” 
Specifically, the $APE will serve as a token to govern the future of the Bored Ape community.
Notably, the token wasn’t created just by BAYC (though the founders are involved). Technically, ApeCoinDAO is the creator of ApeCoin. The problem? $APE seems to be replicating a lot of the problems that members of the NFT community decry in traditional capitalism: Venture capitalists and centralization.
Usually, those who have more tokens have more sway in a DAO’s governance.
A spokesperson for Yuga Labs confirmed that they and other launch partners received a collective total of 14% (140 million tokens). That’s the same amount that the entire BAYC community received, which is comprised of tens of thousands of individuals. No matter how you feel about it, one has to admit that it does seem like a bit of a loss when it comes to decentralization, which is a central tenet of the NFT community.</p>
